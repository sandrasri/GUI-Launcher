# GUI-Launcher

The project is called GUILauncher, and it allows the user to add GIFs to a list and sort them in any order. When the user clicks play, it automatically launches the selected GIF. Another implementation with songs was also created and is available upon request. GUILauncher was created in February 2024 as part of Northeastern Universityâ€™s CS 2510: Fundamentals of Computer Science 2.
